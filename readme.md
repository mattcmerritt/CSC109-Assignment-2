# CSC109-Assignment-2

## Purpose

This repository was made to practice using the features of Git and GitHub. It includes a simple example of a Student class and a driver class to test the Student class.

## How to Run

To run the driver class, navigate to the ``src`` directory of the project using a command prompt, and run the following lines:

```
javac StudentTest.java
java StudentTest
```

Alternatively, you can import the project into your choice of IDE and run the file named ``StudentTest.java`` in the ``src`` directory.
